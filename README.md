# Udacity DLND Bike Sharing Pattern Project

# Overview
This is udacity's deep learning nano degree project which predicts bikes needed in future using past usage pattern.

# Instructions
1. Install Anaconda and create conda environment.
2. Install numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
3. Clone git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/man-bohara/bikesharing-pattern.git
```
4. Run following command.
```
jupyter notebook Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb
```
5. Follow the insturctions on the notebook.

# Model Architecture
This project doesn't not use any framework such as pytorch, karas etc. This neural network is implemented using plain numpy and python.
I have implemented forward pass and backpropagation. I have used one hidden layer with 6 hidden nodes and 1 output node.
